I've implemented Encapsulation by setting the classes fields to private. This prevents any access to the fields from outside of the class. Public getter and mutator methods are used 
to access and modify the data. This ensures that data can be accessed and modified only as intended by the programmer (i.e. me). 
These fields are initialised by passing horseSymbol, horseName and horseConfidence to the constructor. The constructor assigns these values to the relevant fields,
and setes distanceTravelled to 0, and fallen to false. 

The following getter methods have been defined as public in order to access the data from outside the class:
getConfidence()
getDistanceTravelled()
getName()
hasFallen()
getSymbol()

The following mutator methods enable the confidence and symbol fields to be set from outside the class by making them public as well:
setConfidence()
setSymbol()
